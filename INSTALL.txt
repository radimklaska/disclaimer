Warning
-------
In order to work, disclaimer need client has JAVASCRIPT ENABLED and ACCEPT COOKIE.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE USING PATH.MODULE (URL ALIAS):

Please ensure you have no other pages setup with the URL ALIAS 'disclaimer' when 
installing the disclaimer.module which uses the 'disclaimer' URL Alias by default.

CAUTION ON AGE VERIFICATION:

If you set age form option to your disclaimer, delete cookie and see the modal from "admin/settings/disclaimer", age verification will not work, because of preview windows under modal and CheckAge() js function witch get id of elements.

Requirements
------------

This module require at least version 6.x of Drupal.
This module require 
NyroModal jquery plugin 1.4.2+ from
http://plugins.jquery.com/project/nyroModal
- AND/OR -
jqModal jquery plugin 2008.06.22-r12+ from
http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jqModal

jQuery modal plugin
-------------------

Question: Why can we choose 2 jQuery plugin ? it's a little bit complicated ?
Answer:
* First: because i like let people make their own choice !
* Second: because i first start this module with nyroModal, and found jqModal only recently.
* Third: there is a lot a jQuery plugin modal, so be happy i give only two choice ! ;)

Here is my comparison to help you to get the one you need:

NyroModal :

* Very nice !
* Show, loading and hide style
* Some simple style options
* Full css customization
* Big script ! packed is 18,10 Ko !!

jqModal :

* Very very light ! 3,32 Ko !!
* No loader, no hide style (but 
* No style options, only overlay
* Full css customization

So, here is my advice : 
If you got a lot of js on your site, and don't bother too much about style, get jqModal.
If you think you got not too much on your site and found nyroModal so nice and cool, get it !

Installation
------------

1. Copy the folder named 'disclaimer' and its contents to the modules directory
   of your Drupal installation (for example 'sites/all/modules/').

   -- if you choose nyroModal --

2. Download NyroModal archive (version 1.4.2+) at 
   http://plugins.jquery.com/project/nyroModal

3. Create nyroModal folder in disclaimer module
   sites/all/modules/disclaimer/nyroModal

4. Extract all NyroModal archive content in this folder.
   so directory look likes:
    disclaimer/nyroModal/js/
    disclaimer/nyroModal/img/
    disclaimer/nyroModal/styles/
    
    no need of php files given in NyroModal package.

5. Rename one of the NyroModal script (packed recommended) on "disclaimer/nyromodal/js/" 
   to "jquery.nyroModal.js"

6. Module will use nyroModal.css, rename -full version if you need. Edit to your need.

   -- if you choose jqModal --

   sites/all/modules/disclaimer/jqModal

9. Copy both js and css files in this folder.

  -- whatever your choice --

10. In order to get disclaimer with customizes regions (no sidebar, etc...), copy 
   page-disclaimer.tpl.php file from disclaimer module to your theme directory.
   Edit to your need.
